<b>Title:</b> React-Native-E-Book<br>
<br>
<b>Detail :</b> Hello, In this project, I made an application where people can share the books they read. Each book and its details shared in the application can be seen in the main menu and in the special profile of the people who share it. You can add a profile picture background image! the main goal was to make the function happen and it was successful Ui/UX designs will be fixed in the future!
